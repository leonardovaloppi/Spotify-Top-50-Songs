    "## 0.1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding what makes a song a hit is crucial for platforms like Spotify, where content performance directly impacts user engagement and business decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**This project aims to analyze Spotify’s Top 50 Tracks of 2020 dataset to uncover patterns and insights that define a successful song.** By leveraging data analysis techniques in Python with Pandas, we will explore key factors that contribute to a track’s popularity, including artist influence, genre distribution, and audio features such as danceability, loudness, and acousticness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis will begin with data cleaning to ensure accuracy, handling missing values, eliminating duplicates, and treating potential outliers. Then, through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we will assess the dataset’s structure, identifying the number of observations, features, and categorical or numerical variables. Key business questions will be addressed, such as which artists and albums dominate the charts, what characteristics distinguish high-ranking tracks, and how different genres perform in terms of danceability, loudness, and acoustic properties. Additionally, correlation analysis will reveal which audio features are most strongly related to hit status, providing valuable insights for Spotify’s content curation strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outcomes of this study will help refine music recommendation algorithms, optimize playlist curation, and guide marketing and promotional efforts by identifying trends in consumer music preferences. Further improvements could involve expanding the dataset to multiple years, incorporating listener engagement metrics, and applying machine learning techniques to predict future hits."
